**UNMAINTAINED**: I don't use MSYS2 anymore so I don't maintain this project
anymore. If you want to use shellder, consider the alternatives below:

1.  [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
    - Lowest latency. Utilizes async tasks and gitstatusd.
    - Only for ZSH
    - Not suits with MSYS2 or Cygwin since it's a big shell scripts. (But who uses MSYS2/Cygwin while we have WSL2?)
2.  [starship](https://starship.rs/)
    - Higher latency than powerlevel10k, but still it's faster than most shell themes.
    - Compatible with many shell environments (i.e. Powershell, bash, tcsh, fish, ...)
    - No slowdown in MSYS2 or Cygwin since it's a Rust binary not a shell script.

shellder
========
1. **No solarized** ― xterm256 colors are beautiful enough
2. **zsh** + **fish** support
3. **Speed** ― Carefully optimized for slow environments like MSYS2

## Fonts
You'll need a powerline patched font. If you don't have one, download one or
patch some fonts on you own.
